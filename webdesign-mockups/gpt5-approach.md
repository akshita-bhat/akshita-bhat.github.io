🎨 1. Design Approach

Style: Minimal, modern, and professional (think white background, dark text, accent color for highlights).

Navigation: Top menu bar with 4–5 items (Home, Resume, Portfolio, Blog/Insights, Contact).

Tone: Recruiter-facing → credible, structured; Client-facing → approachable, problem-solver vibe.

Responsive: Must work perfectly on desktop + mobile.

💡 Use a lightweight framework:

If coding: React + TailwindCSS (host on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify).

If no-code: Webflow or Notion → publish quickly.

Storage for design:

Wireframes & mockups: Use Figma (free, web-based, version control).

Actual code: GitHub repo.

Content drafts: Notion or Google Docs.

🏗️ 2. Core Sections to Include

Here’s how to structure it to satisfy both recruiters & freelance clients:

🔹 Home / About

Photo + short tagline (e.g., “Data Scientist | AI Engineer | Builder of Intelligent Agents”).

2–3 sentences about you → career + freelance interest.

Call-to-action: “View Resume” + “Explore Portfolio.”

🔹 Resume (Recruiter-facing)

Interactive timeline of experience (companies, roles, impact).

Download button → PDF resume.

Skills grid (Data Science, ML, AI Agents, Data Engineering, Tools: AWS, SQL, Python, etc.).

🔹 Portfolio (Freelancer-facing)

Each project gets a card layout:

Thumbnail image/GIF.

Title.

2–3 line summary (problem → solution → impact).

Links: GitHub repo, live demo, writeup.

👉 Group by category:

AI Agents (chatbots, PDF Q&A, finance bot)

ML Models (claims severity, desirability score)

Data Engineering (AWS pipelines, cost optimization scripts)

Data Viz & Apps (dashboards, Streamlit apps)

🔹 Blog / Insights (Optional, but powerful)

Short articles on things you’ve learned → shows thought leadership.

Examples: “How I saved $500/day with cloud optimization,” “Building an AI agent in Flowise.”

🔹 Contact

Simple form (Name, Email, Message).

Links to LinkedIn, GitHub, Upwork/Fiverr.

🧭 3. Navigation Flow for Each Audience

Recruiter: Home → Resume → Portfolio → Contact.

Freelance Client: Home → Portfolio → Case Study → Contact.

So your site must allow both audiences to reach their goal in 2 clicks max.

🚀 4. Future-Proofing

Use Figma to design mockups → easy to tweak.

Store design files in GitHub repo (for versioning) or Notion (if you want quick notes).

Deploy MVP first → 3–4 polished projects + resume. Add blog/case studies later.
